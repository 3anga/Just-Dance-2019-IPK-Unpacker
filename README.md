<h3>Just Dance 2019 IPK File Unpacker</h3>
<p>
 To unpack an .ipk file from Just Dance simply drag and drop the .ipk file onto the ipk_unpacker.py script.
 Or you can run it via command line as "python ipk_unpacker.py your_ipk_file"
</p>

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<p>The script will loop through the packed files and create a directory for each of them. If a folder already exists with the same name it will overwrite it</p>

<h4>Extra</h4>
<p>If the need for a re-packer rises I will be more than happy to make one, as for now the demand is not high enough to catch my attention</p>
